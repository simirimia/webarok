			<summary><![CDATA[&quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot; is the third single from Green Day\'s 1995 album Insomniac released in 1996. The two songs are transitional: &quot;Brain Stew&quot; ending and moving right into &quot;Jaded&quot; without the music stopping. They are tracks 10 and 11 on both Insomniac (the band\'s second major-label album, and fourth overall) and the 2001 greatest-hits album, International Superhits!.

			<content><![CDATA[&quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot; is the third single from Green Day\'s 1995 album Insomniac released in 1996. The two songs are transitional: &quot;Brain Stew&quot; ending and moving right into &quot;Jaded&quot; without the music stopping. They are tracks 10 and 11 on both Insomniac (the band\'s second major-label album, and fourth overall) and the 2001 greatest-hits album, International Superhits!. The two were very popular, and they became an alternative rock radio staple.\r The composition of &quot;Brain Stew&quot; is relatively simple. The song contains only five power chords, five bass notes, and a relatively simple drum pattern. Many of Green Day\'s fans consider it to be one of their first songs to appear in the repertoire of many garage bands. Billie Joe Armstrong has stated that he used as many as 10 guitar overdubs to achieve the scratchy dissonant sounds in the latter part of the song.\r \r The intro to &quot;Panic Song&quot; is often played in between &quot;Brain Stew&quot; and &quot;Jaded&quot; at live performances, although the key is changed to be relevant with the songs.\r \r ]]></content>
