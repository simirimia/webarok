pyGenreTagger is a python script which grabs tag information from last.fm 
and updates the genre tag of MP3 files.
It filters the tags so that in the end hopefully a uselful information is
written to the file. Tag mappings can be defined to unify the genre naming.


0. Prerequisites
================

You need to have installed
1. Python (tested with version 2.6)
2. Python mutagen library (packge: python-mutagen on kubuntu 9.10)


1. Installation
===============

Get the sourcecode and place it somewhere on the same computer as 
your local music library is attached to.


2. Configuration
================

You can configre the tag mappings and the tag blacklist. Both is defined in the file
tag/GenreHandler.py.

BLACKLIST:
Search for the line "tagBlacklist = [ " (currently line 31) and add/remove entries to 
this list. Take care that you never forget the , at the end of a line! If you do so, 
no error is triggerd but all following entries are not taken into account.
Especially check the part "# tags I personally dislike", this are some tags I do not 
want to have as genre in my media library, but other people may like them. If you do so,
just remove the entry from that list.
 
GENRE MAPPING:
Search for the line "tagMapping = {" (currently line 107) and add/remove entries to this
dictionary. 
The entry
    'spoken word'               : 'speech', 
will replace the tag 'spoken word' by the genre 'speech'.


3. Using the tagger
===================

A GUI is in preparation, but for now only the command line interface is usable:

cd <<Whereever you copied the sources>>
./tagger.py -m MODE -b BASEDIR

mode is either dry for a dryrun or update for really updating the files
use -m MODE or --mode=MODE
    -b BASEDIR or --basedir=BASEDIR

BASEDIR must be an absolute path

Some examples:

Check what genre tagger would do with the whole music library, but
don't change anything:
./tagger.py -m dry -b /home/$USER/Music


Check a subfolder (most likely one artist):
./tagger.py -m dry -b /home/$USER/Music/Green\ Day


Update all music files in a subfolder:
./tagger.py -m update -b /home/$USER/Music/Green\ Day


If you want to try out the GUI (really ugly, do not complain I didn't warn you):
tagger.py -g [--gui]
