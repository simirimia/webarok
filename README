Webarok is a web based remote control for Amarok.

0. Prerequisites
================

You need to have installed
1. Amarok 2 (tested with 2.1 and 2.2 beta)
2. Python (tested with version 2.6)
3. Python dbus bindings (package python-dbus on kubuntu)
4. A webbrowser


1. Installation
===============

Get the sourcecode and place it somewhere on the same computer as 
Amarok is running


2. Configuration
================

Webarok can show album art. For this it is neccessary to have access to 
the folder on the filesystem, where Amarok stores the album art.
Normally this folder is:
/home/<<$USERNAME>>/.kde/share/apps/amarok/albumcovers/

To restrict the access of webarok to this folder, open the file 
Configuration/Configuration.py and edit the line

self.artfolder = "/home/***PLEASE CHANGE THIS***/.kde/share/apps/amarok/albumcovers/"

to match the folder with your setup


3. Starting Webarok
===================

Make sure Amarok is already running. Open a terminal and enter:

cd <<Path/to/Webarok>>
python webarok.py

If everything is OK, there should be some output like:

init MyDbus class
Starting webarok server


4. Using Webarok
================

Open a browser and connect to the computer where webarok is running on port 8085. 
If you started the browser on the same box as you installed webarok, then enter:

http://localhost:8085/

Now Webaroks interface should be visible and you are able to control Amarok via 
this interface.  Have fun with it now :)


5. Troubleshooting
==================
